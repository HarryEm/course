# CME 212 Grading Guidelines

We want to see functioning, clear, elegant code that is readable, cleanly
designed, well-decomposed, and commented appropriately.

## Broad categories
 
* [60%] Functionality
* [20%] Design
* [10%] Style
* [10%] Documentation / Write-up

In each category, overall feedback will be summarized with:

* `+`: exceptional work, rarely granted
* `ok`: work meets specification and reasonable quality standards
* `-`: work is lacking in at least one area
* `--`: work is lacking in two or more areas
* `0`: assignment missing or highly problematic

## Functionality

### High priority

* Correct functionality on test cases
* Performance is in reasonable bounds on all test cases

### Medium priority

* Output conforms to spec
* Clean compile
  * C++: program compiles, no warnings under strict compiler flags 
  * Python: no syntax errors
* Clean run
  * C++: no segfaults under any cases
  * C++: valgrind is clean under all cases
  * Python: no fails on exception tracebacks in any cases unless allowed by hw spec

### Low priority

* Correct files present
* Clean repo (according to hw specs)

## Design

* Modular code, decomposed into appropriate logical units (functions/classes)
* Use of proper data structures
* Efficient algorithm implementation

## Style

* Cleanliness and readability
* Language conventions


## Write up

* The problem to be solved is stated clearly
* Produced results are described in sufficient detail
* Formatting of text or PDF file is clean and easy to read
* Language is mostly correct and easy to follow
* Correct answers to questions asked in assignment specification

## Code quality notes

Cleanliness/readability

* code is free of clutter: remove all dead code and unused vars/fns
* use of whitespace/indentation is tidy and consistent
  * split long lines if necessary (screenwidth ~80 chars)
  * 2-4 spaces per indent level (use spaces to indent instead of tabs to avoid editor inconsistency)
  * whitespace used to visually support logical separation
* variable/function names are consistent and descriptive
  * good naming conventions help avoid need for additional commentary
  * use consistent scheme for capitalization/underscores
* use constants/#define'd/sizeof/variables instead of hardcoded numbers
* comments are present where warranted, prose is correct and helpful
  * overview comments (per-function, per-module) with summary highlights
  * inline comments used sparingly where needed to decipher dense/complex lines
  * no excess verbiage that reiterates what code itself already says

Language conventions

* choose the most clean, direct, conventional syntax available to you
* avoid unnecessary use of obscure constructs
* use standard language features appropriately, e.g.
  * `bool` instead of `int` for true-false scenarios

Program design

* program flow decomposed into manageable, logical pieces
* function interfaces are clean and well-encapsulated
* appropriate algorithms used, coded cleanly
* common code is unified, not duplicated
  * when you need same lines more the once, don't copy and paste -- unify!
* use standard library functions rather than re-implement that functionality, e.g.
  * string manipulation, formatted I/O, sort/search, type conversion, etc.

Data structures

* data structures are well-chosen and appropriate
* no redundant storage/copying of data
* no global variables
