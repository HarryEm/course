# CME 212 - Winter 2017

## Description

This is a course emphasizing designing, building, testing, maintaining, and
modifying software for scientific computing. Students will work on a variety of
projects, from small data transformation utilities to large-scale systems.
Students will learn to use a variety of tools approaches for software design, as
well as various techniques for organizing teams. Most important, students will
learn to fit tools and approaches to the problem being solved.

## Communication

- Please check the [FAQ document][cme212-faq] for answers to common questions.
  This is the best place to look for information regarding course capacity and
  waitlist.

- The [CME 212 Canvas page][cme212-canvas] is available to all Stanford students.
  Please ask questions related to course material in the Canvas discussion forum.
  We also use Canvas to post homework assignments and announcements.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Apply basic software development tool-chains, including source-code
  control, testing frameworks, and documentation tools, to the
  process of designing and implementing large software systems;

- Use a variety of approaches to software development team
  organization, and select techniques that are appropriate in
  different circumstances;

- Apply design principles to the decomposition of software into
  reusable components, and to the production of those components;

- Know how to approach an existing piece of software for maintenance,
  extension, and modification;

- Design, develop, and deploy a set of software components to produce
  a scalable, reliable, and reproducible experimental system for
  scientific investigation.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have programming and computing systems experience at
the level of CME 211. This course will primarily use C/C++.

## Intended Audience

The course is aimed at students with a background in a scientific discipline who
will not typically have a traditional computer science background (though basic
programming knowledge is assumed as a prerequisite). We hope to attract students
from the life sciences, physical sciences, economics, social sciences, medicine,
and the humanities. Computer science and engineering students are also welcome
to take this class.

## Course Content

The class will be organized as a series of topic areas, each centered around a
set of tools and a motivating project. Students will complete a series of 5
programming assignments.

### C/C++

- Pointers, arrays, strings
- Memory management
- Abstractions and naming
- Templates and STL
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Encapsulation, classes, namespaces
- Constructors and destructors
- Tools: Introduction to UNIX, Git, Make, C/C++, IDE

### Theory

- Specifications
- Complexity and correctness
- Program, loop, and representation invariants
- Type systems
- Abstract data types and abstract program values
- Imperative vs Object-Oriented Programming
- State machines and design, event-based programming
- Consistency and replication
- Tools: Introduction to analysis and documentation, unit
  testing/verification

### Development

- IDEs
- Documentation and design
- Source code control
- Iterative development and code reviews
- Documentation (DOxygen)
- Tools: Introduction to build management and collaborative
  development

### Refinement and Topics

- Performance and optimization
- Parallelism, multithreaded applications and concurrency
- Distributed data
- Scripting test suites
- Tools: Introduction to refactoring, debugging, profiling,
  optimization

## Assessment

The course grade breakdown will be:

- 50% programming assignments (5 homeworks on 2 week intervals)
- 20% conceptual exercises (3 exercise sets throughout quarter)
- 30% final exam

## Books

Required readings will be assigned from:

- Lippman, Lajoie, Moo. *C++ Primer, 5th edition*

- [*http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9780133053043*](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9780133053043)

Recommended resources:

- Gamma, Johnson, Vlissides, Booch. *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
  Object-Oriented Software.*
- Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. *Introduction to Algorithms.*
- Stroustrup. *The C++ Programming Language.*

## Honor Code

You are welcome to discuss the course's material and homework with others in
order to better understand it, but **the work you turn in must be your own
unless collaboration is explicitly allowed**. You may not submit the same or
similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning
the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can
also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or
libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. Making your
work available for copy by other students is also prohibited (unless the
assignment explicitly allows collaboration). Violations of
the
[*Stanford Honor Code and Fundamental Standard*](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/student-conduct-process/honor-code-and-fundamental-standard) will
be forwarded to the Stanford University Office of Community Standards.

This computer science website has a good explanation of the honor code as it
relates to courses involving significant amounts of computer programming:

[*http://csmajor.stanford.edu/HonorCode.shtml*](http://csmajor.stanford.edu/HonorCode.shtml)

Note that we will use special computer software to assist us in detecting
plagiarism:

[*http://theory.stanford.edu/\~aiken/moss/*](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)

If you are having difficulty completing an assignment please contact a TA or the
instructor so that we may help you. We would much rather spend time helping you
than dealing with honor code violations.

## Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a
disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education
(OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation,
recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for
faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students
should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to
coordinate accommodations. Information about the OAE may be found
at:
[*http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae*](http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).
